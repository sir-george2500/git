NAME
----
git-diff-pairs - Compare blob pairs generated by `diff-tree --raw`

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git diff-pairs' [diff-options]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Given the output of `diff-tree -z` on its stdin, `diff-pairs` will
reformat that output into whatever format is requested on its command
line.  For example:

-----------------------------
git diff-tree -z -M $a $b |
git diff-pairs -p
-----------------------------

will compute the tree diff in one step (including renames), and then
`diff-pairs` will compute and format the blob-level diffs for each pair.
This can be used to modify the raw diff in the middle (without having to
parse or re-create more complicated formats like `--patch`), or to
compute diffs progressively over the course of multiple invocations of
`diff-pairs`.

Each blob pair is fed to the diff machinery individually queued and the output
is flushed on stdin EOF.

To explicitly flush the diff queue, a single nul byte can be written to stdin
between filepairs. Diff output between flushes is separated by a single line
terminator.

NOTES
----

`diff-pairs` should handle any input generated by `diff-tree --raw -z`.
It may choke or otherwise misbehave on output from `diff-files`, etc.

Here's an incomplete list of things that `diff-pairs` could do, but
doesn't (mostly in the name of simplicity):

 - Only `-z` input is accepted, not normal `--raw` input.

 - Abbreviated sha1s are rejected in the input from `diff-tree`; if you
   want to abbreviate the output, you can pass `--abbrev` to
   `diff-pairs`.

 - Pathspecs are not handled by `diff-pairs`; you can limit the diff via
   the initial `diff-tree` invocation.
